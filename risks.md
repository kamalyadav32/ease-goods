Þ **Financial Risk**

Investing in a Start-up business is the biggest risk because there no surety of its success. So getting the investment is the biggest challenge. As my business is a trucking based business so I’ll be needing a large amount of investment for buying trucks, making website and for the wear and tear of truck parts. If the business fails in the market I could lose all my financial funds, So the Chances of business failure can be minimized by proper planning.

Sometimes the shippers and big companies take up to months to clear the previous bills. This cycle and drain a considerable amount of money and result in limiting ventures growth.

Þ **Team Risk**

Making a good team of skilled and trustworthy employees also plays a great role in building a successful business. In my venture, The drivers play a major role, and according to a current survey, there is a shortage of 48000 drivers nationwide. Because of the early retirement age of fifty-six years and fewer people are choosing truck driving as their career. As a result of which the limited drivers are working overtime which makes them restless, which further increases the risk of accidents.

Team risk can be minimized by recruiting team members carefully.

Þ **Government policies**

Understanding government policies play an important role as they keep on changing

Besides changing they vary from province to province. There was a tax implemented by the Indian government in July 2107 which had the greatest impact on the trucking business than any other logistics. The tax is called Goods and Services Tax(GST). So such immerging policies by the government in the society affects the venture very much. This also impacts the economic growth. This is a very unpredictable risk because one never knows when and why the government changes the rules.

For the betterment of this venture and reducing this risk, one should keep track of the government policies. To avoid the penalties and tickets. It is mandatory to drive a vehicle with all the rules and regulations in order to avoid. It may be a lucrative business to start.

Þ **Market Risk**

Market risk involves the risk of changing place in the market in which every company competes for business. Since my venture is an early mover so there might be a risk for maintaining a reputation in the market. There is a risk of losing customers from the rapid increase in driver shortage based on a survey the gap between the supply and demand of drivers could be over 33,000 vacancies. Because of this, there is a possibility of losing customers due to missed delivery from truck sitting idle. For maintaining the reputation in the market we will motivate our drivers to deliver the goods to the right person on time. This will decrease losing customers and further the market risk.

Þ **Accidental Risk**

Driving the biggest vehicle on road is a challenge and there is always a danger of accidents and causalities. Many of the industries are becoming safer, recent data suggests the trucking industry is becoming more deadlier. In a blink of eye, accident could become worst. There are different reasons that could lead to a major accident such as mechanical failure, restlessness of driver, natural hazard, overloading, etc. other than accidents the drivers also suffers from different injuries like stress and sprain, fractures, cuts, lacerations, and multiple traumatic injuries while loading-unloading, or preparing and inspecting their vehicle. Poor health also puts drivers at risk of sleep apnea.

To minimize these kinds of accidents we’ll promote better drive fitness and encourage them to participate in regular fitness activities. For the Goods, we will provide the best insurance coverage on discounted rates for the customers. We’ll also add more sensors in the trucks to avoid collision. And for the health of Drivers, there will be proper health checkup quarterly to avoid any deadly disease and we will also provide them with good health insurance.
